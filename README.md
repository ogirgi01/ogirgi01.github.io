Lab #1

1. The index was succesfully linked to all the other html files. Images were succesfully posted onto the page. There were a few errors with the HTML5 which I wasn't able to work through, however the pages display the way I wanted them to.

2. I discussed the assignment with my fellow classmates Elif Kinli and Jade Chan. 

3. I spent around 6 hours on this assignment.

<p id="bio">  
	Ogul was born in Istanbul, Turkey and spent all his life there, that is, until his college career began. Born into a nuclear family of artists, Ogul grew up in an environment deeply submerged in a multitude of artistic platforms. He went through his elementary school education in Bilfen, and his high-school education in Robert College. He is currently studying Engineering Psychology and Art History at Tufts University.
